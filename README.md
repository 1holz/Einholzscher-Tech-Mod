The Einholzscher Tech Mod is just another Minecraft Tech Mod for Fabric.

Currently just adds a coal generator and an ore grower which can "grow" ores from smaller bits of the mineral. Also adds a wrench. With this it is possible to afk-farm most ores. And fullautomatically farm redstone and lapis. The recipes can be configured with datapacks.

Example setup of a lipis generator:
